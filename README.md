  <i>Please note that the app above is the 'example2.pyw' code, The class itself ONLY contains the Color Picker shown at the top left, Consider checking out 'exmaple.pyw' for better understanding.</i>
</p>

## Requirements
The only requirement for this code is `PyQt5`. To install it, simply run the following command:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```
## Integration into Your Project
To successfully integrate the color picker into your project, make sure to include both the `assets` folder and the `ColorUtils.py` file. Without these components, the color picker won’t function as expected.
## Usage
For a practical demonstration of how to use the color picker, refer to the `example.pyw` file. Execute it to explore the color picker’s features firsthand.
